# runctl: Terminal-Based Running Analytics Platform

## Project Goals
runctl is a terminal-based running analytics platform designed for software engineers and data enthusiasts who appreciate command-line interfaces. The platform solves several key problems:
- Inaccurate heart rate data in running activities
- Lack of terminal-based tools for running analytics
- Need for transparent data processing in fitness tracking
- Limited access to raw fitness data for custom analysis

## Current Phase: Foundation
We are currently implementing Phase 1 of the project, focusing on:
- Multi-source heart rate data cleaning (FIT + Stryd CSV)
- Power-based heart rate validation using Stryd data
- Command-line interface for file processing
- Data alignment and validation between sources

## Key Features (Phase 1)
- Smart heart rate anomaly detection and correction using multi-source validation
- Power-based heart rate zone validation (Stryd integration)
- FIT file format support
- Stryd CSV format support for power data validation
- Configurable cleaning parameters
- Data quality reporting

## External Resources
- [Project Management Documentation](https://www.notion.so/runctl) (to be created)
- [GitHub Issues Board](https://github.com/yourusername/runctl/issues) (to be created)

## Target Users
- Software engineers who run
- Data engineers interested in fitness analytics
- Technical users who prefer terminal-based tools
- Athletes who want more control over their training data
